# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Load Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance and conduct comprehensive load testing to meet performance targets
# Details:
Use k6.io for load testing with scenarios targeting 10,000+ orders/minute. Implement database query optimization with EXPLAIN ANALYZE. Add connection pooling optimization. Implement GraphQL query complexity analysis and limits. Add response caching strategies. Use pprof for performance profiling and optimization. Implement graceful shutdown and circuit breakers.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load tests meeting performance targets (<100ms response time, 10k orders/minute), verify database query performance, test circuit breaker functionality, validate caching effectiveness, test graceful shutdown behavior
