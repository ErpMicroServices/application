# Task ID: 17
# Title: Build Comprehensive BDD Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Behavior-Driven Development tests using Cucumber for all fulfillment scenarios
# Details:
Use cucumber/godog v0.12.6+ for BDD testing. Create feature files for: order processing pipeline, route optimization, real-time tracking, inventory allocation, payment processing. Implement step definitions in Go. Set up test database with fixtures. Create test data factories for orders, customers, products. Add API testing with httptest package. Implement parallel test execution.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all BDD scenarios pass, test data isolation between scenarios, validate test execution performance, ensure test coverage of critical user journeys, test parallel execution stability

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up BDD testing framework and project structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Cucumber/godog framework, create directory structure for feature files and step definitions, configure test runner with parallel execution support
### Details:
Install cucumber/godog v0.12.6+, create features/ directory for .feature files, create steps/ directory for step definitions, set up godog test suite configuration with parallel execution options, create test configuration files for different environments

## 2. Create comprehensive feature files for all fulfillment scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Write Gherkin feature files covering order processing pipeline, route optimization, real-time tracking, inventory allocation, and payment processing scenarios
### Details:
Create order_processing.feature with scenarios for order creation, validation, and status updates. Create route_optimization.feature for delivery route planning scenarios. Create real_time_tracking.feature for shipment tracking scenarios. Create inventory_allocation.feature for stock management scenarios. Create payment_processing.feature for payment workflow scenarios. Include positive, negative, and edge case scenarios for each feature

## 3. Implement step definitions in Go for all feature scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Create Go step definition files that implement the Given/When/Then steps defined in feature files, with proper error handling and test context management
### Details:
Create step definition files for each feature area using godog framework. Implement context management for sharing data between steps. Add proper error handling and assertions. Create helper functions for common operations like database setup, API calls, and data validation. Implement step definitions for order processing, route optimization, tracking, inventory, and payment scenarios

## 4. Set up test database with fixtures and data factories [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create isolated test database environment with seed data, implement data factories for generating test entities, and ensure proper test data cleanup
### Details:
Set up separate test database configuration, create database migration scripts for test schema. Implement data factories for orders, customers, products, and related entities using builder pattern. Create fixture files with predefined test data sets. Implement database cleanup and reset functionality between test scenarios. Add support for test data isolation to prevent test interference

## 5. Integrate API testing with httptest and implement test execution pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Add HTTP API testing capabilities using httptest package, create test execution pipeline with reporting, and optimize for parallel execution performance
### Details:
Integrate httptest package for API endpoint testing within BDD scenarios. Create HTTP client helpers for making API requests in step definitions. Implement test execution pipeline with proper setup/teardown. Add test reporting and result aggregation. Configure parallel test execution with proper resource management. Create CI/CD integration scripts for automated test execution
