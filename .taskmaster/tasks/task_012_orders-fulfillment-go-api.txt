# Task ID: 12
# Title: Integrate Shipping Carrier APIs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement multi-carrier shipping integration with rate shopping and label generation
# Details:
Create carrier interfaces for FedEx, UPS, USPS APIs. Implement rate shopping service to compare shipping costs and delivery times. Use carrier-specific SDKs or REST clients. Create shipping_labels table for label storage. Implement address validation using carrier APIs. Add support for international shipping with customs documentation. Create carrier_configs table for API credentials and settings.

# Test Strategy:
Test rate shopping across multiple carriers, verify label generation and printing, test address validation, validate international shipping documentation, test API error handling and fallbacks

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Carrier Interface and Configuration System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the base carrier interface and configuration management system for multi-carrier integration
### Details:
Create a generic carrier interface defining methods for rate calculation, label generation, and tracking. Implement carrier_configs table with fields for API credentials, endpoints, and carrier-specific settings. Create configuration service to manage API keys, test/production modes, and carrier preferences. Implement factory pattern for carrier instantiation based on configuration.

## 2. Implement FedEx API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate FedEx shipping services including rate calculation, label generation, and address validation
### Details:
Implement FedEx carrier service using FedEx REST APIs. Create methods for rate shopping, shipping label generation, and address validation. Handle FedEx-specific data formats and error responses. Implement authentication using OAuth 2.0 for FedEx API access. Add support for FedEx service types (Ground, Express, International) and packaging options.

## 3. Implement UPS and USPS API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate UPS and USPS shipping services with rate calculation and label generation capabilities
### Details:
Implement UPS carrier service using UPS REST APIs with OAuth authentication. Implement USPS carrier service using USPS Web Tools API. Create unified response format for both carriers to match the carrier interface. Handle carrier-specific service types, packaging options, and delivery confirmation methods. Implement proper error handling and retry logic for API failures.

## 4. Create Rate Shopping and Label Management Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Implement rate shopping service to compare carriers and create shipping label storage system
### Details:
Create rate shopping service that queries multiple carriers simultaneously and returns sorted results by cost and delivery time. Implement shipping_labels table with fields for label data, tracking numbers, carrier info, and metadata. Create label generation service with support for different label formats (PDF, PNG, ZPL). Implement label retrieval and reprint functionality. Add rate caching to improve performance.

## 5. Implement Address Validation and International Shipping [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Add address validation capabilities and international shipping support with customs documentation
### Details:
Implement address validation service using carrier APIs to verify and standardize addresses. Create customs documentation generation for international shipments including commercial invoices and customs forms. Add support for duty and tax calculations. Implement restricted/prohibited items checking for international destinations. Create address_validations table to cache validation results and improve performance.
