# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Repository Pattern for Data Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create repository interfaces and PostgreSQL implementations for all domain entities with optimized queries
# Details:
Create interfaces: OrderRepository, OrderItemRepository, OrderAdjustmentRepository. Implement PostgreSQL versions using squirrel v1.5.4+ for query building. Include methods: Create, GetByID, GetByCustomerID, Update, Delete, List with pagination. Implement bulk operations for order items. Use prepared statements for performance. Add soft delete support with deleted_at column.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with test database, verify CRUD operations, test pagination and filtering, validate transaction handling, test concurrent access scenarios

# Subtasks:
