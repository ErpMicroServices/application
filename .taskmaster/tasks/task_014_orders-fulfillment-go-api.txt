# Task ID: 14
# Title: Build AI-Powered Route Optimization Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement machine learning algorithms for delivery route optimization and time estimation
# Details:
Integrate with Google Maps API or similar for route calculation. Implement genetic algorithm for multi-stop route optimization using github.com/MaxHalford/eaopt v0.4.2+. Create route_optimizations table for storing calculated routes. Add factors: traffic patterns, delivery time windows, vehicle capacity, driver preferences. Implement caching for frequently used routes. Use historical delivery data for time estimation improvements.

# Test Strategy:
Test route optimization with various order combinations, verify time estimation accuracy, test performance with large order sets, validate constraint handling (time windows, capacity), test route caching effectiveness
