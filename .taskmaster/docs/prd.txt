- Payment states: Pending → Authorized → Captured → Settled → Refunded
- Exception handling for failed state transitions

### Database Integration
- Leverage existing PostgreSQL schema from order-database module
- Implement Go models matching existing database structure
- Add audit fields and soft delete capabilities
- Optimize queries for high-performance order processing
- Implement connection pooling and transaction management

### GraphQL Federation
- Extend existing types from other subgraphs (products, customers)
- Implement proper federation directives (@key, @external, @requires)
- Design schema for optimal query performance
- Support real-time subscriptions for order updates
- Implement proper error handling and validation

## BDD Test Scenarios

### Order Processing Pipeline
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Order Fulfillment
  Scenario: Process order through entire fulfillment pipeline
    Given I have a confirmed order with available inventory
    When I trigger the fulfillment process
    Then the order should progress through picking, packing, shipping
    And inventory levels should be decremented
    And tracking information should be generated
    And customer notifications should be sent
    And delivery estimates should be calculated

Feature: Intelligent Route Optimization  
  Scenario: Optimize delivery routes for multiple orders
    Given I have 10 orders in the same geographic area
    When I run the route optimization algorithm
    Then the system should generate the most efficient delivery route
    And estimated delivery times should be updated
    And total delivery cost should be minimized
    And driver workload should be balanced

Feature: Real-time Tracking Integration
  Scenario: Track shipment with IoT sensors
    Given I have a shipment with IoT sensors attached
    When the shipment is in transit
    Then I should receive real-time location updates
    And temperature/humidity data should be monitored
    And alerts should be triggered for exceptions
    And delivery confirmation should be automated
```

### Advanced Logistics Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: AI-Powered Demand Forecasting
  Scenario: Predict inventory needs based on order patterns
    Given historical order data for the past 12 months
    When I run the demand forecasting algorithm
    Then the system should predict future inventory needs
    And automatic replenishment orders should be suggested
    And seasonal demand patterns should be identified

Feature: Smart Contract Payment Processing
  Scenario: Automate payment on delivery confirmation
    Given an order with smart contract payment terms
    When the delivery is confirmed via IoT sensors
    Then the smart contract should execute payment automatically
    And both parties should receive payment confirmation
    And the order status should be updated to completed
```
